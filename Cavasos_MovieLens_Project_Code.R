# Introduction


# In 2006, Netflix launched a challenge with a one million dollars prize to anyone who could enhance their movie recommendation system 
# by at least 10%. This initiative drew widespread attention from technology enthusiasts, academics, and the media, marking a 
# significant venture into analyzing vast quantities of movie ratings from hundreds of thousands of users. Although the winning 
# algorithm from this challenge was never adopted by Netflix, the competition itself was instrumental in driving advancements in 
# artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, highlighting the burgeoning field's potential for innovation.

# The Capstone Project for the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science aims to delve into the MovieLens dataset. The 
# project's goal is to construct a machine learning model capable of predicting movie ratings with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 
# of less than 0.8649 using training and test sets. RMSE serves as acritical metric for evaluating the accuracy of machine learning models, 
# measuring the standard deviation of prediction errors and the disparity between observed and predicted values. 

# The MovieLens dataset is designed to support personalized film recommendations and includes over 25 million ratings across 
# 62,000 movies by 162,000 users as of its December 2019 release. The HarvardX Capstone Project will not only examine this dataset 
# to understand viewers' preferences better but also develop and compare distinct models based on their RMSE outcomes, underscoring 
# the importance of accurate predictive analytics in enhancing user experience and the strategic application of machine learning in 
# real-world scenarios.


# Methods and Analysis

# This project begins with installing essential R packages for data handling and visualization such as tidyverse, 
# caret, and ggplot2. Subsequent steps include downloading and preparing the MovieLens dataset through data cleaning and structuring. The 
# analysis phase involves data wrangling to merge movie ratings with their titles and genres, partitioning the data into training and 
# validation sets, and conducting extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify distribution 
# patterns, outliers, and potential biases. 

# The modeling phase develops predictive models, starting from a simple baseline to more complex ones incorporating movie age, movie 
# popularity, and user biases, and applying regularization techniques to enhance accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using the Root 
# Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric, with the final model selection based on achieving the lowest RMSE, thus demonstrating the project's 
# success in accurately predicting movie ratings.

# Modelling Approach


# We are going to construct a loss-function to calculate the Residual Mean Squared Error. This serves as our accuracy metric, 
# representing the average error in ratings we might expect. Within the formula, $\hat{y}_u,_i$ i = the prediction of movie m by 
# user u, and $y_u,_i$ = the rating of movie m, by user u. N is defined as the total number of unique user/movie pairings, 
# representing the sum of these combinations. Here is the formula: 
#  $$\mbox{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{u,i}(\hat{y}_u,_i-y_u,_i)^2}$$
  
   
RMSE <- function(true_ratings, predicted_ratings){
  sqrt(mean((true_ratings - predicted_ratings)^2))
}
 

# Let's create baseline model using the simplest formula to naively predict all ratings as avg rating of the training set. 
 
mu <- mean(edx$rating)

 

# Using unknown ratings, we create our first RMSE. This baseline model can be defined as $y_u,_i$ = predicted rating, $\mu$ = the 
# average rating, and $\varepsilon_{u,i}$ = independent errors centered at 0. Here is the formula:
# $$y_u,_i = \mu + \varepsilon_{u,i}$$
 
RMSE_Baseline <- RMSE(edx$rating, mu)
 

# Then, create a table to record model performances.

## Movie Age Bias

# Given that older films tend to receive higher ratings, this model includes "Movie Age" biases, which recognize variations in 
# how movies released during different years are rated. This phenomena is denoted as ba, where "b" stands for bias and "a" represents age. With $y_{u,i}$ = predicted 
# rating, $\mu$ = average rating, ba = “movie age bias” variable and $\varepsilon_{u,i}$ = independent errors centred at 0.

# To enhance our model, we will consider the notion that certain movies are subjectively rated higher than others. Generally,

# The final model achieves an RMSE of 0.8258! 

# This project has culminated in applying the best-performing model to a validation set to verify its predictive accuracy, 
# achieving an RMSE below the predefined threshold. This methodical approach, from initial data exploration and cleaning 
# through to sophisticated modeling and validation, illustrates the power of data science techniques in uncovering insights 
# from complex datasets and developing predictive models with practical applications.

# CONCLUSION
##########################################################################################################################


# This project successfully implements several models, progressively incorporating movie age, popularity, and user biases with regularization
# to improve prediction accuracy. The final model achieves an RMSE of 0.8258, surpassing the project's goal of an RMSE below 0.8649. 
# These models, however, assume that user and movie biases, and year of movie release are sufficient to predict ratings and may not capture more complex 
# interactions or preferences that could improve predictions, (such as genre, ratings per user, etc). 
# The exploration indicates potential for further enhancement by exploring additional biases and more advanced techniques
# (e.g., Distributed Random Forests or K-Nearest-Neighbors), suggesting avenues for future work to refine predictions.
